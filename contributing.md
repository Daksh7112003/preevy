# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

Preevy is open source and we love to receive contributions from the community. Here are a few ideas for contributions:

* Expand and correct the documentation where needed
* Add examples and how-tos for using Preevy in various scenarios: Guides on adding Preview Environments for your favorite front-end framework, Example CI integrations for more providers.
* Submit bug reports and fixes
* Improve the UX
* Add automated tests
* Add missing functionality; small or big features (example of the latter: drivers for more cloud providers)

When contributing, please follow the guidelines:

* Open a PR, issue or discussion on the repo to communicate your intents.
* Either add automated tests or make sure the relevant and adjacent flows are manually tested.
* Fix the documentation to reflect code changes where applicable.
