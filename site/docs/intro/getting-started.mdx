## Introduction

Use `preevy` to provision your [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application with minimal configurations.<br/>
Simply run `preevy up`, and `preevy` will return a public URL for every service in your configuration.

You can read more about the `preevy` [origin story and motivation](/intro/motivation).

## Getting Started

`preevy` is designed to be easy to use, with an API smiliar to [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

:::info Cloud provider credentials
Managing and provisioning preview environments in `preevy`, requires access and credentials to a cloud provider.<br />
Once you install and set up the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), `preevy` will recognize and employ your configuration settings.
:::

Install the CLI globally

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g preevy
```

Or use it directly

```bash
npx preevy <command>
```

Set up a profile

```bash
preevy init
```

From the same directory you run `docker comopse up` run:

```bash
preevy up
```
